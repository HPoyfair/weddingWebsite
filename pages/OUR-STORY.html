            <p> Our story began last summer in the most unexpected of places—a rock climbing gym. What started with belaying each other up walls soon turned into something much more. It didn’t take long for us to realize we were a perfect match, complementing each other in ways we never imagined. Hayden’s steady hand and my occasional “panicking at the top” moments made it clear—we could face anything together.
            <p>
                But it wasn’t just the climbing that brought us together. It was the music! Hayden, with his love for guitar, hazed me a little with his endless guitar playing (and trust me, I did <i>not</i> see that coming). But as they say—sometimes you just have to sing your way into someone’s heart! And that’s exactly what I did. I couldn’t resist joining in, and before we knew it, our shared love of music became the soundtrack to our relationship. From spontaneous karaoke nights to jam sessions and singing Selena in the car, we’ve found harmony in more ways than one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our relationship is also deeply rooted in faith. We both share a love for Jesus Christ, and that bond is what truly connects us. Our faith not only guides us individually but also as a couple, and we’re excited to continue growing in Christ as we grow together.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of our favorite nightly traditions is our inside joke: “Five more minutes?” It’s our little way of stalling the end of the day, because let’s be real—who wants the day to end when you’re with your favorite person?
            </p>
            <p>
                We are beyond excited to share one of the biggest days of our lives with you, and we can’t wait to celebrate the love, laughter, and music that have brought us here. Thank you for being part of our story—we’re so grateful to have you with us on this journey! See you at the wedding!
            </p>
